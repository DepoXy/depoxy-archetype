# NOTE: This awk doesn't check that the first line contains "USAGE:".
#       It just prints output until the first blank line, stripping
#       leading comment characters; and it ignores any line that starts
#       with a comment character and a space followed by "USAGE:".
#       - The convention just happens to be that we start the header
#         with a "USAGE:" line to remind ourselves that the code
#         atop such files in this repo are processed through `eval`.
#       - We could instead remove the "USAGE:" check and just use
#         `tail -n +2`, and assume that the first line is not
#         `eval` code.
#       - Or we could update this `awk` to enforce the "USAGE:"
#         convention. But that doesn't add much value, other than
#         double-checking that the code atop the file is really
#         code that the developer intends to run through `eval`.
#       - But we're already running code through `eval`, which is
#         somewhat dangerous (also very powerful). And we only run
#         `eval` on files from this repo (found via `git ls-files`)
#         that have "EVAL" in their filename.
#         - Basically, as as long as we trust our own repo, and our
#           own work, we should be okay. If something bad happens,
#           it will have been our own fault.

# TRYME: Here's how you can test and verify this function, e.g.,
