# Some examples to show how to include additional project-specific Git config:

# # Apply config to all repos under a broader business organization.
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/BUSINESS_CODE_PATH/<org>/"]
#   # USAGE: Store the config in the DepoXy Client.
#   # - See the example (use `gF` to jump Vim):
#   path = DXY_DEPOXY_CLIENT_TILDE/home/client/CLIENT_BIZUNIT/.gitconfig-CLIENT_BIZUNIT.example

# # SAVVY: Gitconfig honors ~ tilde expansion, but not variable expansion.
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/BUSINESS_CODE_PATH/<org>/<repo>/"]
#   # Skip the pre-commit hook (which runs tests, and is slow).
#   path = ~/.kit/git/git-smart/gitconfigs/commit-no-verify.gitconfig

# Add '[ci skip]' to WIP commits to not break GitLab pipeline
# (by not activating the pipeline). Also use on PRIVATE commits
# to guard in case you zonk and push scoped commits.
# - Remove/change as necessary for your Git service.
