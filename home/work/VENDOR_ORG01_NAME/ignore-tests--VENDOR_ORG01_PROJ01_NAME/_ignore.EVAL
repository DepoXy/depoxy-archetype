# Note this file is used to describe a useful pattern,
# but it's not something you need to worry about when
# setting up a DepoXy Client.
#
# The use case is wanting to search different ways on the same project
# using the Vim dubs_grep_steady plugin.
#
# - E.g., you might want your normal project to be inclusive, and to
#   include all repo files. But you might also want to do more
#   restrictive searches, e.g., excluding test files.
#
#   - You could do this from the command line, e.g.,
#
#       rg -g !'*.test.js' "foo"
#
#       # OR, more obtusely:
#       rg --ignore-file <(echo '*.test.js') "foo"
#
#   - But it's not convenient to customize rg options that grep-steady
#     uses. So if you want to configure different searches on the same
#     projects via grep-steady, you can use a little trick:
#
#     - Create a shell directory that contains a custom .ignore rules
#       file, and add a symlink to the project you want to search. Then
#       add this shell directory path to your dubs_projects.vim file.

# ***

# This example .projlns/ project shows how to make a separate grep-steady
# entry (in `home/dubs_projects.vim`) that excludes certain files when
# searching a project's files.
#
# - In the same directory as this file, add a symlink to the project.
# - In this file, add rule(s) to ignore the files you don't want to grep.
# - In `home/dubs_projects.vim`, add an entry with this file's directory.
#       ~/.depoxy/running/home/.vim/dubs_grep_steady/dubs_projects.vim
#   - Restart Vim, or :GrepSteadyReload.
# - Remove these comments and rename this file .ignore.example -> .ignore
#
# - Update DXY_DEPOXY_CLIENT_TILDE/.mrconfigs/_mrconfig-DXY_VENDOR_NAME
#   to make the ~/.projlns/DXY_VENDOR_HOME_NAME symlink on infuse.
#   CXREF: wire_testless_greppable in
#     DXY_DEPOXY_CLIENT_TILDE/.mrconfigs/_mrconfig-DXY_VENDOR_NAME
# - Call `infuse` to create the ~/.projlns symlink.

# E.g., you might find it easier to get to know a new JavaScript that
# you're working on if you ignore keyword hits in test files.
