# *** Ignore all vendor projects

# YOU: Decide if you want to ignore everything else under
#      DXY_VENDOR_HOME_TILDE or not.
#
# - If the following rule is disabled, you'll be reminded if your
#   DXY_VENDOR_HOME_TILDE house is not tidy.
#
#   - If an untracked change is a new project repo that you
#     cloned, you could add a new Git ignore rule herein, e.g.,
#
#       DXY_VENDOR_HOME_EXCLUDE_RULE[[[]]]DXY_VENDOR_ORG02_NAME/DXY_VENDOR_ORG02_PROJ01_NAME/
#
#     But it might also be a reminder to add a new project to the
#       DXY_DEPOXY_CLIENT_TILDE/.mrconfigs/_mrconfig-DXY_DEPOXY_VENDOR_NAME
#     config (or one of the configs that it loads), if you happened
#     to clone a work project directly and forgot to add it to your
#     myrepos config.
#
#   - Otherwise, if an untracked change is something else, maybe
#     this reminds you to commit that change to the necessary repo.
#
# We'll start with this rule enabled, because it might annoy new
# users if their DXY_VENDOR_HOME_TILDE directory keeps showing up
# as untidy from ${HOME}/.
