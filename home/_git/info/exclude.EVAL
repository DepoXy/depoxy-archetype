# YOU: Decide if you want to ignore everything under ~/work or not.
# - If this rule is disabled, you'll be reminded if your ~/work
#   house is not tidy, and you'll be compelled to add a Git ignore
#   rule herein.
#   - The real advantage is that you might also be reminded to add
#     a new project to the ~/DXY_DEPOXY_CLIENT_TILDE/_mrconfig-DXY_VENDOR_NAME
#     mrconfig, if you happened to clone a work project directly,
#     without using myrepos.
# We'll start with this rule enabled, because it might annoy new
# users if their ~/work directory keeps showing up as untidy from
# ${HOME}/.

/DXY_VENDOR_HOME_EXCLUDE_RULE/

# If you symlinked ~/work, also this path
# (Aka suggested directory name for @biz code):
