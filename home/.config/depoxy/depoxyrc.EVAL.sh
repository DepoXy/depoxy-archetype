# BWARE: Be sure to edit this file from within your DepoXy Client project.
#        - Do not edit ~/.config/depoxy/depoxyrc, which is a copy, and
#          will be overwritten on `mr infuse`.

# USAGE: Edit this file ‚Äî then call `infuse`.

# SAVVY: This file is essentially used to set
#
#          export DEPOXY_IS_CLIENT=true
#
#        on the client machine.

# CXREF: See also the private Bashrc that's sourced on Bash init, which
#        is a better place to customize most aspects of the environment:
#
#           ~/.depoxy/ambers/archetype/home/bashrx.private.HOSTNAME.sh
#
#        But note that this file is meant to be persistently accessible,
#        whereas a `23skidoo` will unmount your DepoXy Client project,
#        including `home/bashrx.private.HOSTNAME.sh`.

# BWARE: While DepoXy *tries* to support personalized (non-standard) paths,
#        e.g., perhaps `DEPOXYDIR_BASE_FULL="${HOME}/your/preferred/path"`,
#        the author has not tested this functionality. You're welcome to
#        try, and you're welcome to submit PRs, but there's no guarantee
#        you won't find issues.

# NOTE: The DEPOXY_IS_CLIENT environ duplicates an older mechanism,
#       which was to check a hostnames file:
#         DXY_DEPOXY_CLIENT_TILDE/.hostnames
#       The .hostnames file is still used as a validity check to
#       verify that certain functions are only run on the client,
#       or not run on the client.
#       - Search DEPOXY_HOSTNAMES_NAME for usage.
# MAYBE: We could remove this variable if we made a depoxy_fs.sh
#        function that returns true if host matches ./.hostnames
#        file. Or maybe we could remove .hostnames now that this
#        environ is available. Not the DRYest, but not used much.
