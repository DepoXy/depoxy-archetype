Just a reminder that ``home/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`` is an exported
copy of the Karabiner-Elements config.

- This config export should be a reflection of all the JSON files that are
  in the Karabiner-Elephants project::

    ~/DXY_DOPP_KIT_NAME/mOS/Karabiner-Elephants/complex_modifications

  As well as JSON files in the DepoXy Ambers project::

    DXY_DEPOXYAMBERS_DIR/home/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications

  Plus any private modifications you might have added for this specific
  DepoXy Client, at::

    DXY_DEPOXYDIR_STINTS_HOME/DXY_DEPOXY_CLIENT_ID/home/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications

-------

Also a reminder to look at Karabiner-Element's log screen if you
enabled a new mapping and find that it's not working.
