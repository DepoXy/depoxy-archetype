# To keep the ~/.gitconfig from git-smart and the ~/.gitconfig.local
# from DepoXy developer-agnostic, we keep the [user] config separate.
#
# - Obviously, you might have more than Git two personas, but this supports
#   only two users, one for business code, and another for personal code.
#
# - Use `.gitconfig.user-personal` for your personal Git user and Git
#   email. This will be the default Git committer for git operations.
#
# - Use `.gitconfig.user-business` for your corporate Git user and email.
#   This will be the default Git committer for git operations done to
#   repos under a specific directory:
#     ~/BUSINESS_CODE_PATH
#
# - If you need to add more users or tweak these rules, you can set the
#   user and email specially for specific projects running `git config`
#   on that repo, and you could codify that process using the _mrconfig.
#
#   Or you could add more includeIf rules and new gitconfigs as necessary.
